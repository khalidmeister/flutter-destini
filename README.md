## Projek Belajar Flutter: OOP

This time, I'm applying some OOP principles for making this app with guidance from the course. From this section, I've learned a lot for using Object Oriented Programming that use principles of abstraction (decompose problem), encapsulation (data cannot be updated outside of the class), inheritance (methods and attributes can be inherit from super class), and polymorphism (some method could be change or update based on what user's need).

- Name App: Destini
- Software: Flutter and Visual Studio Code
